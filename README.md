# Simple-NN-for-MNIST-Digit-Classification
This project uses a Neural Network (NN) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset (42,000 images). The model is built with TensorFlow/Keras, normalizes pixel values, and predicts digits (0-9). It includes preprocessing, training, and evaluation steps with accuracy visualization. ðŸš€
